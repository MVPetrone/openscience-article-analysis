This is my first markdown document

```{r,  setup=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/PC/Desktop/projects/R")
data <- read.csv("./data.csv")
library(dplyr)  # Load the dplyr package for data manipulation

average_transparency <- data %>%
  group_by(Journal) %>%
  summarise(AvgTransparency = round(mean(Transparency.score..1.5.), 2))
print(average_transparency)
```

Bar Chart Depiction


``` {r, setup=FALSE}
# Optionally, reorder the data to match the original ordering
sorted_data <- average_transparency[order(average_transparency$AvgTransparency), ]

barplot(
  sorted_data$AvgTransparency,
  names.arg = sorted_data$Journal,
  main = "Average Transparency Score by Journal",
  xlab = "Journal",
  ylab = "Average Transparency Score",
  col = "steelblue",
  las = 2,  # Rotate axis labels for readability
  ylim = c(0, 5)  # Set the y-axis to range from 0 to 5
)

```

Transparency Score Metrics Key

- \(\mathbf{1}\) = No data no code
- \(\mathbf{2}\) = Some shared data or code but not accessible
- \(\mathbf{3}\) = Some shared data or code and partially accessible
- \(\mathbf{4}\) = Some shared data or code and fully accessible
- \(\mathbf{5}\) = Fully shared data and code and fully accessible
