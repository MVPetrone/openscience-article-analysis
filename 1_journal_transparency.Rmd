This is the Journal Transparency Data

- Transparency score key:
    - 4 = Excellent = Fully shared data and code and fully accessible
    - 3 = Good = Some shared data or code and fully accessible
    - 2 = Basic = Some shared data or code and partially accessible
    - 1 = Bad = Some shared data or code but not accessible
    - N/A = No data no code shared


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

data <- read.csv("FINALDATA2.csv")

# Calculate average transparency score by journal
average_transparency <- data %>%
  # First, convert the 'Transparency' column from text to numbers
  mutate(
    Transparency_Numeric = case_when(
      Transparency == "Excellent" ~ 4,
      Transparency == "Good" ~ 3,
      Transparency == "Basic" ~ 2,
      Transparency == "Bad" ~ 1,
      Transparency == "N/A" ~ NA_real_, # Convert "N/A" to R's NA (Not Applicable)
      TRUE ~ NA_real_ # Catch any other unexpected values as NA
    )
  ) %>%
  # Now, group by Journal and calculate the mean of the new numeric column
  group_by(Journal) %>%
  summarise(AvgTransparency = round(mean(Transparency_Numeric, na.rm = TRUE), 2))

# Print the result
print(average_transparency)
```

Bar Chart Depiction

```{r}
# Optionally, reorder the data to match the original ordering
sorted_data <- average_transparency[order(average_transparency$AvgTransparency),]

barplot(
  sorted_data$AvgTransparency,
  names.arg = sorted_data$Journal,
  main = "Average Transparency Score by Journal",
  xlab = "Journal",
  ylab = "Average Transparency Score",
  col = "steelblue",
  las = 2,  # Rotate axis labels for readability
  ylim = c(0, 5)  # Set the y-axis to range from 0 to 5
)

```
